# Overview

GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

GitHub essentials like repositories, branches, commits, and Pull Requests. 

Pull Requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. When you open a pull request, youâ€™re proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch. 

These are 2 types: </br>
1. Github Global   </br>
    **https://github.com** </br>
2. Github Enterprise </br>
    **e.g https://github.dev.cybozu.co.jp** </br>

# B. Operation with GibHub in Basic
**Taget: get the latest version on local **</br>
UsingTerminal in Mac or Command Prompt or Powershell in Windows.


## 1. Initializing a Repository on local

    $ cd e:/project/github-project
    $ git init
    Initialized empty Git repository in E:/project/github-project/.git/

Result: creates a new subdirectory named .git that contains all of your necessary repository files


## 2. Cloning an Existing Repository
* Clones=copy a repository into a newly created directory, creates remote-tracking branches for each branch in the cloned repository, run by command git clone <url\>
* <url\> get from git server

## 5. git status
* To know the file status, by run the git status command

        e.g created a myfile.md into your repository by command $ touch myfile.md
